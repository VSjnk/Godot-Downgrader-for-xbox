<h1>About this project</h1>
<p>This began as a way for me to play my godot games on xbox, without having to re-program my code all for godot 3, and to make it so that I don't have to make a custom godot 4 build with UWP support. However, I now realise that this can also be used with HomeBrodot, which allows you to port your godot 3 games to swich and PSP!</p>
