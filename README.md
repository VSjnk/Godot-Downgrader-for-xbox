<p> Create away to automatacly convert tilemaps.</p>
<p> add Godot 4.4 tilemap compatibility</p>
<p> Add more node conversion names</p>

<h1>About this project</h1>
<p>This began as a way for me to play my godot games on xbox, without having to re-program my code all for godot 3, and to make it so that I don't have to make a custom godot 4 build with UWP support. However, I now realise that this can also be used with HomeBrodot, which allows you to port your godot 3 games to swich and PSP! (PS, this was originally made in godot 4.4)</p>

<h3>How to use</h3>
<p>I am terrible about making tutorials but here I go</p>
<p>either make a folder and/or place your Godot 4.3 and under project into the "import" folder</p>
<p>if it's your first time loading this, check "copy all files"</p>
<p> and hit convert! it's that easy!</p>
<p>you may need to add a project.godot file, but you whole project can load currently with a bunch of issues</p>

<h2>Just know that I am very open to people adding to this, and if you know how to make the tilemap conversion, please make a fork and I'll most likely add it to this. If you just want to use it to convert your projects, anything that requires custom data will not work yet, as this is not complete. I know the way i'm doing this is VERY weird, but it gets the job done</h2>
